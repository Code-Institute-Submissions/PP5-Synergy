## Agile Development
The Agile framework is an iterative approach to software development. Instead of delivering a final working product at the end of the development lifecycle, teams work in small timeframes.

### Stage 1: Ideation


[Synergy](https://github.com/Hussain-Naik/PP5-Synergy) is a task management application to allow user to manage task alone or with other users. Users can create or join multiple workstreams and easily assign or pick up tasks that suit the users preference.

#### Strategy

Developed for all levels of users from beginners to professional, the app is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. The main goal of the app is to help groups organize and keep track of tasks.

#### FEATURES

Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all features-related documentation.

---

#### Design

The design of the application is based on the Material Design principles.
The central theme of the application is the simplicity of use. Thus, all the components are designed to be easy to use. The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of focus. As this application is a multifunctional one and consists of many components, the decision to implement white spaces was made as it helps to create a more pleasant user experience. 

##### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the application is based on Prime React color scheme:

[Color Scheme](https://primereact.org/theming/#builtinthemes)

In Summary the prime react color scheme allows the application to be visually appealing and consistent in the design while reinforcing the applications identity to enhance the overall user experience.

##### Typography

As the application is designed using prime react library entirely the decision to stay with the typography for its consistency as is uses a native font stack that selects the best font-family for each OS and device

##### Imagery

- The main part is allocated to the use of icons from [Primeicons](https://primereact.org/icons/) website. The use of icons is essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.

### Stage 5: Operations

#### Future Improvements and Features

**Subscriptions**

In the future I would like to implement the use of subscriptions plan for user access

**Sign-up and Login options**

In the future I would like to add sign-up and login with Facebook, Google, and other social media platforms.
Also, I would like to add an option to use a phone number instead of an email and send a verification code to the user's phone.

**Asynchronous functionality**

In the future I would like to make the application asynchronous. So all elements in the frontend will be updated real-time as soon as the backend sends the data.

**Security improvements**

In the future I would like to make the application foolproof against attacks and security vulnerabilities.

**User settings**

In the future I would like to more customization options for the user.

**Group chatting**

In the future I would like to add group chatting for participants.
